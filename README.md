## 💬 Why Work With Me?
I’m new to commissions, and I understand why that might make you hesitant.  
But here's what I *can* promise:

- I’m honest and direct  
- I work hard and don’t cut corners  
- I write clean, maintainable, well-structured code  
- I stay in communication while working  
- I take pride in meeting — and exceeding — expectations

If you hire me, I’ll treat your project with the same care and discipline I give my own.
